About the Project
This is a minimalist and responsive web application that functions as a counter. The project's main goal was to create a clean, modern user interface while demonstrating fundamental front-end development skills. It's a great example of a simple yet polished application that showcases a strong understanding of core web technologies.

Technologies and Concepts Used
This project was built using the following core web technologies and concepts:

HTML: The app's structure is built with semantic HTML5 to ensure a clean and accessible foundation.

CSS: The design relies heavily on CSS for a modern aesthetic, utilizing:

Flexbox: For creating a responsive and well-aligned layout.
Gradients & Box Shadows: To give the UI a polished, three-dimensional look.
CSS Transitions & Keyframes: For smooth hover effects and the "pop" animation on the counter display, enhancing user experience.
JavaScript: The app's interactive functionality is driven by vanilla JavaScript, highlighting key concepts:

DOM Manipulation: We use document.getElementById() to select elements and textContent to dynamically update the counter display.
Event Handling: The addEventListener() method is used to respond to user clicks on the buttons, triggering the counter's logic.
Conditional Statements: An if/else if statement is used to change the color of the number based on whether the count is positive, negative, or zero.
setTimeout(): This method is used to manage the timing of the CSS animation, ensuring the "pop" effect is triggered correctly on each count update.
